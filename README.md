# Bangla-Sentence-Error-Correction
The goal of this project was to develop a software model that could fix grammatical and syntax errors in Bengali text. The approach was similar to how a language translator works, where the incorrect sentence is transformed into a correct one. Here, I fine-tune a pertained model, namely mBart50 with a dataset of 1.3 M samples for 6500 steps and achieve a score of BLEU: 0.595, CER:0.029, WER:0.125 when tested on unseen data.The models overall accuracy 87%..Clone/download this repo, run the App.py script, and type the sentence after the prompt and you are all set.
